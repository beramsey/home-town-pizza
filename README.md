This is final project for Code Kentucky Web Dev 1 November 18th, 2022. 
I made a mockup for a local pizza restaurant with basic information like food menu, photos, and contact/location information. The page includes repsonsive navigation, an accordian box restaurant menu, photo slideshow, and contact information. I ran Pagespeed insights from my developer tab of chrome by clicking the lighthouse tab. Google pagespeed insights gave the project a score of 99. Below I will include a list of completed requrements.

List Requirements:
1. Created a responsive menu with css (flexbox). Reqirement begins on line 14 of index.html and line 16 of style.css.
2. I selected to run Pagespeed Insights with a score of 60 or better, but I ended up with a score of 99. A photo of this result can also be found in my "project information" folder in this git.
